excerpt: 'The International Ice Patrol (IIP) has been responsible for the safety of maritime
activity related to icebergs in the North Atlantic since their founding in the wake of the
Titanic disaster in April 1912. In the century to follow, the Ice Patrol, their mission,
methods, and technology have evolved. Today, a century of iceberg observation data
collected by the IIP has led to a growing field of climatological and hazards sciences related
study. This study examines the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation
(AO) as drivers of iceberg presence south of 48°N through direct and secondary influence
between 1983 and 2020. This study is divided into five sections which examine different
aspects of the relationship between teleconnections and icebergs south of 48°N (I48N). The
first section identifies that the NAO and AO have statistically significant correlation with the
number of I48Ns at a 1-year lag, through the use of linear regression modelling. The second
section determines through the use of logistic regression that there is a statistically significant
increase likelihood of an Extreme (>1399) iceberg year in years following a high annual
NAO Index. Section three includes the comparison of AIC values for different AO/NAO
models, which concluded that NAO is a stronger driver of North Atlantic icebergs than the
AO. Section four involves a twofold analysis of the role of sea ice in iceberg-teleconnection
interactions. These analyses resulted in the finding that sea ice has a significant correlation
with I48N counts at 0- and 1-year lags. Additionally, this section indicates a significant
correlation between sea ice and AO at a 1-year lag. Section five consists of comparing
reanalysis(NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, NCEP/DOE R2) data of meteorological and 
oceanographic factors in the 3 most-recent high and low iceberg years. This comparison
identified areas of future study including geopotential height, sea level pressure and sea
surface temperature.'
