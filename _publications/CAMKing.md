excerpt: 'C.A.M. King, the noted British coastal geomorphologist, authored two books in a three-year period. Beaches and Coasts in 1959 was a major contribution to coastal geomorphology, whereas Oceanography for Geographers represents Kingâ€™s attempt to show the importance of the oceans to all of geography. Their approaches and pedagogy differ, but their lessons remain relevant today.'
