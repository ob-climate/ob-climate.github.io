About Me 
======
I grew up in Wallingford, Connecticut, graduating from Mark T. Sheehan High School in 2011. I then completed my B.A in Geography/History at Southern Connecticut State University in '16, my M.S in Geosciences in at Fort Hays State University in '18, and my Ph.D. in Geography from Texas State University in '22. I currently [teach](https://ob-climate.github.io/teaching/) as an Adjunct Lecturer at Southern Connecticut State University, Central Connecticut State University, and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. My research interests involve the atmosphere-ice-land-ocean system, expecially in the North Atlantic. I am broadly interested in Climate Change, and Environmental Issues (And Solutions!). These topics make up the majority of my teaching portfolio. I live in Connecticut with my wife Elizabeth. 

**As a Climate Change Communicator, I focus on the broad strokes of climate change, Which can best be summed up in 7 Questions**:

1. What is Climate Change?

2. Why is it occurring? 

3. How do we know what we know?

4. Where will the impacts be felt?

5. When will impacts begin? Have they already?

6. Who is responsible?

  and of course...

*What can I do about it!*

Through quality data and good science, we can answer these questions, and all the new ones that arise as a result!

I will be covering each of these topics in my [Blog](https://ob-climate.github.io/year-archive/)!
