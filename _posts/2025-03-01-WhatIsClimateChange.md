What is Climate Change? In the year 2025, this is a far more complex question than it appears at face value. 
If you've ever walked outside and taken a breath of fresh air,then you already understand much of what I'll discuss here!
This blog is a perfect place to start especially for brand-
new interested citizen scientists.

This article covers the basics, and provides a series of causal relationships within our Earth Systems that 
help to make understanding climate change as simple as looking out the window. I also address common misconceptions about climate change.

The Facts
======

Usually, when we discuss climate change in 2025, we are usually refering to *anthropogenic* climate change, meaning, climate changes due *primarily to human activity*.
That's not the only type of climate change, but it is the one we are currently dealing with. Over geologic time, our planet has been subject to **many** cycles of natural climatic changes. 
What we are currently seeing as far as global tempterature rise, does not reflect the expected behavior of those natural changes. When we include human activity, the equation is balanced. 
We'll come back to this a bit later on. First, however, we need to begin with the first fact in our arsenal. 

**Fact #1: Carbon Dioxide absorbs more heat than Air**

Molecules are a great place to begin to understand the most important relationship in climate study, that of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>.) and Air Temperature. Well of course, you won't find "Air" on the periodic Table,
*Air* in this case refers to the specific mix of gasses that makes up the majority of our atmosphere (Namely, ~79% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, and some other trace elements) These trace elemesnts are what we are interested in. 

Many of these elements, and molecules are called *greenhouse gasses*, or GHGs. Greehouse gasses are the gases in the atmosphere of a planet, that absorb heat energy and keep a planet warm. 
Sometimes, a little too warm. The process by which a planet's atmosphere absorbs heat is called the **Greenhouse Effect!**

How do we know this? In 1856, Connecticut Native Eunice Foote published the results of a very simple experiment in her paper "Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun's Rays" published in the American Journal of Art and Science" in November of 1856. In her Experiment, Ms. Foote filled one vessel with "common air", and another with what was at the time called *Carbonic Acid Gas* or CO<sub>2</sub> as we know it today. I will allow Ms. Foote to describe her own results.

*Note: Temperatures below are given in Â°F, but are presented exactly as Ms. Foote did in the original article*

> "The highest effect of the sun's rays I have found to be in carbonic acid gas.
> One of the recievers (vessels) was filled with it, the other with common air, and the result was as follows:
> <table>
  <tr><th>In Common Air </th><th>In Carbonic Acid Gas</th></tr>
  <tr><td>

  |In shade.| In sun. |
  |--|--|
  |80| 90|
  |81| 94|

> The reciever containing the gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) became itself much heated---very sensibly more so than the other---and on being removed, it was many times as long in the cooling" 
>-- <cite>Eunice Foote, 1856</cite>


And just like that, a discovery was made that carries far more relevance in 2025 than it did 4 years before Lincoln's Election. To Boil that discovery down to a single sentence?
Carbon Dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) absorbs *more* heat than common air, and takes *much longer* to cool down. 

Okay, so we've established that Carbon Dioxide is good at absorbing heat, (And that we've known it for nearly two centuries), lets take alook at some evidence of this in action from our nearest neighbors, 
the terrestrial planets! They will help us to explain our second fact.


**Fact #2: An atmosphere with more CO<sub>2</sub> will absorb more than one with less CO<sub>2</sub>**

Greenhouse Gasses exist in the atmospheres of planets, and depending on the chemical composition, absorb heat at different rates. 
Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and Water Vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), are, in that order, the most impactful greenhouse gasses we have in our atmosphere.
On Earth, until very recently and with few exceptions, our greenhouse effect was in balance. Meaning the earth eventually lost all of the extra heat it absorbed. 
Other planets are not so lucky. (Image of the greenhouse Effect)

Take Earth's "Evil Twin" for instance. Venus is a very hot planet. Its even hotter than Mercury which is closer to the sun. Why? Because of its Atmosphere!
Carbon Dioxide on Venus is like Nitrogen on Earth, it is the primary gas in Venus's atmosphere. 
What is the result? What we call a *runaway greenhouse effect*. A runaway greenhouse effect occurs when every day, little by little, a planet holds on to just a little bit more heat than it did the day before, and releases a little less too. This means that a when planet's greenhouse effect is out of balance, and will continue to heat up, as long as the amount of available greenhouse gasses continues to increase.
